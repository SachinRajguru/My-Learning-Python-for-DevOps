# Task 2: Relationa (Comparison) Operators

# Step 1: Define two numeric variables
a = 10
b = 5

# Step 2: Perform comparison operations
less_than = a < b               # True if a is less than b
greater_than = a > b            # True if a is greater than b
less_than_or_equal = a <= b     # True if a is less than or equal to b
greater_than_or_equal = a >= b  # True if a is greater than or equal to b
equal = a == b                  # True if a is equal to b
not_equal = a != b              # True if a is not equal to b

# Step 3: Print the results
print("a < b:", less_than)
print("a > b:", greater_than)
print("a <= b:", less_than_or_equal)
print("a >= b:", greater_than_or_equal)
print("a == b:", equal)
print("a != b:", not_equal)
