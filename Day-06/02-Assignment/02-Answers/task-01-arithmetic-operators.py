# Task 1: Arithmetic Operators

# Step 1: Define two numeric variables
a = 10
b = 5

# Step 2: Perform arithmetic operations
sum_result = a + b            # Addition
difference_result = a - b     # Subtraction
product_result = a * b        # Multiplication
quotient_result = a / b       # Division (returns a float)

# Step 3: Print the results
print("Sum:", sum_result)
print("Difference:", difference_result)
print("Product:", product_result)
print("Quotient:", quotient_result)
