# Arithmetic Operations in Python

## Introduction

Arithmetic operators in Python allow you to perform basic mathematical calculations on numeric values. These operators include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more.

## List of Arithmetic Operators

1. **Addition (`+`):** Adds two numbers.  
2. **Subtraction (`-`):** Subtracts the right operand from the left operand.  
3. **Multiplication (`*`):** Multiplies two numbers.  
4. **Division (`/`):** Divides the left operand by the right operand (always results in a floating-point number).  
5. **Floor Division (`//`):** Divides the left operand by the right operand and rounds down to the nearest whole number.  
6. **Modulus (`%`):** Returns the remainder of the division of the left operand by the right operand.  
7. **Exponentiation (`**`):** Raises the left operand to the power of the right operand.

## Examples

### Addition

```python
a = 5
b = 3
result = a + b
print(result)  # Output: 8
```

### Subtraction

```python
x = 10
y = 7
result = x - y
print(result)  # Output: 3
```

### Multiplication

```python
m = 4
n = 6
result = m * n
print(result)  # Output: 24
```

### Division

```python
p = 7
q = 2
result = p / q
print(result)  # Output: 3.5
```

### Floor Division

```python
p = 7
q = 2
result = p // q
print(result)  # Output: 3
```

### Modulus

```python
p = 7
q = 2
result = p % q
print(result)  # Output: 1
```

### Exponentiation

```python
base = 2
exp = 3
result = base ** exp
print(result)  # Output: 8
```

## Summary

   - Arithmetic operators perform basic mathematical calculations.
   - They include `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, and `**`.
   - `/` always gives a float, while `//` gives the integer (floor) result.
   - `%` is useful for finding remainders, and `**` is used for powers.
