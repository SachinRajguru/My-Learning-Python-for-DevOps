# Relational Operations in Python

## Introduction

Relational operators in Python are used to compare two values and determine the relationship between them.
They always return a Boolean result: either `True` or `False`.

## List of Relational Operators

1. **Equal to (`==`)**: Checks if two values are equal.  
2. **Not equal to (`!=`)**: Checks if two values are not equal.  
3. **Greater than (`>`)**: Checks if the left operand is greater than the right operand.  
4. **Less than (`<`)**: Checks if the left operand is less than the right operand.  
5. **Greater than or equal to (`>=`)**: Checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.  
6. **Less than or equal to (`<=`)**: Checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.  

## Examples

### Equal to (`==`)

```python
a = 5
b = 5
result = a == b
print(result)  # Output: True
```

### Not equal to (`!=`)

```python
x = 10
y = 7
result = x != y
print(result)  # Output: True
```

### Greater than (`>`)

```python
a = 8
b = 3
result = a > b
print(result)  # Output: True
```

### Less than (`<`)

```python
x = 4
y = 9
result = x < y
print(result)  # Output: True
```

### Greater than or equal to (`>=`)

```python
a = 6
b = 6
result = a >= b
print(result)  # Output: True
```

### Less than or equal to (`<=`)

```python
x = 3
y = 5
result = x <= y
print(result)  # Output: True
```

## Summary

   - Relational operators compare two values and return a Boolean (`True` or `False`).
   - Commonly used in **conditions**, such as `if` statements and loops.
   - Examples:
      - `a == b` → checks equality
      - `a > b` → checks if left is greater
      - `a <= b` → checks if left is less than or equal
