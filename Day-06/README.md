# Introduction to Operators in Python

Operators in Python are special symbols or keywords used to perform operations on variables and values. Python supports a wide range of operators, categorized into several types. These operators allow you to perform tasks such as arithmetic calculations, assigning values, comparing values, performing logical operations, and more.

## Main Types of Operators

1. **Arithmetic Operators:**  
   Used for basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more.

2. **Assignment Operators:**  
   Used to assign values to variables. Includes the basic assignment operator (`=`) and compound assignment operators (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, etc.).

3. **Relational (Comparison) Operators:**  
   Used to compare values and determine their relationship. Returns a Boolean result (`True` or `False`). Examples: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`.

4. **Logical Operators:**  
   Used to combine and manipulate Boolean values. Includes `and`, `or`, and `not`.

5. **Identity Operators:**  
   Used to check if two variables point to the same object in memory. Operators: `is` and `is not`.

6. **Membership Operators:**  
   Used to check if a value is present in a sequence or collection (like a list, tuple, or string). Operators: `in` and `not in`.

7. **Bitwise Operators:**  
   Used to perform operations on individual bits of binary numbers. Includes bitwise AND (`&`), OR (`|`), XOR (`^`), NOT (`~`), left shift (`<<`), and right shift (`>>`).

8. **Operator Precedence:**  
   Operators in Python have different levels of precedence, which determine the order in which operations are performed in an expression.
