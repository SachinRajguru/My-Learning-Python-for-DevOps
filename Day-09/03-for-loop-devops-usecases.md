# For Loop DevOps Use-Cases

The **for loop** is one of the most powerful tools in DevOps automation.  
It allows engineers to repeat tasks across multiple servers, environments, files, or resources without manual effort.

Below are some practical DevOps use cases where `for` loops (in **Bash** or **Python**) are commonly used.

---

## 1. Server Provisioning and Configuration

When setting up multiple servers (e.g., installing agents, updating packages, or applying configurations), a `for` loop helps automate the task.

**Bash Example:**

```bash
servers=("server1" "server2" "server3")

for server in "${servers[@]}"; do
    configure_monitoring_agent "$server"
done
```

**Python Example:**

```python
servers = ["server1", "server2", "server3"]

for server in servers:
    print(f"Configuring monitoring agent on {server}")
```

---

## 2. Deploying Configurations to Multiple Environments

DevOps engineers often deploy the same configuration to **development, staging, and production** environments.

**Bash Example:**

```bash
environments=("dev" "staging" "prod")

for env in "${environments[@]}"; do
    deploy_configuration "$env"
done
```

**Python Example:**

```python
environments = ["dev", "staging", "prod"]

for env in environments:
    print(f"Deploying configuration to {env} environment")
```

## 3. Backup and Restore Operations

Automating database or service backups is a common DevOps task.

**Bash Example:**

```bash
databases=("db1" "db2" "db3")

for db in "${databases[@]}"; do
    create_backup "$db"
done
```

**Python Example:**

```python
databases = ["db1", "db2", "db3"]

for db in databases:
    print(f"Creating backup for {db}")
```

---

## 4. Log Rotation and Cleanup

Large systems generate massive logs. A loop helps automate **rotation** and **deletion** of old logs to save disk space.

**Bash Example:**

```bash
log_files=("app.log" "access.log" "error.log")

for log_file in "${log_files[@]}"; do
    rotate_and_cleanup_logs "$log_file"
done
```

**Python Example:**

```python
log_files = ["app.log", "access.log", "error.log"]

for log_file in log_files:
    print(f"Rotating and cleaning {log_file}")
```

---

## 5. Monitoring and Reporting

`for` loops are used to check **system metrics** or **service health** across multiple machines.

**Bash Example:**

```bash
servers=("server1" "server2" "server3")

for server in "${servers[@]}"; do
    check_resource_utilization "$server"
done
```

**Python Example:**

```python
servers = ["server1", "server2", "server3"]

for server in servers:
    print(f"Checking resource utilization for {server}")
```

---

## 6. Managing Cloud Resources

In cloud automation (AWS, Azure, GCP), loops are used to manage **instances, storage, and services** at scale.

**Bash Example:**

```bash
instances=("instance1" "instance2" "instance3")

for instance in "${instances[@]}"; do
    resize_instance "$instance"
done
```

**Python Example:**

```python
instances = ["instance1", "instance2", "instance3"]

for instance in instances:
    print(f"Resizing cloud instance {instance}")
```
