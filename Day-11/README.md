# Dictionaries, Sets, and GitHub Integration

## Overview

We explored Python **dictionaries** and **sets**, their differences, and practical use cases. Additionally, we practiced a demo on **GitHub integration** using Python scripts.

## Key Concepts

### Dictionaries
- Store data in **key-value pairs**.
- Keys are unique; values can be duplicated.
- Common operations: `get()`, `keys()`, `values()`, `items()`, `update()`, `pop()`.

### Sets
- Unordered collection of **unique elements**.
- Supports set operations: union, intersection, difference.
- Ideal for membership testing and removing duplicates.

### Lists vs Sets
| Feature        | List                 | Set                  |
| -------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| Mutability     | Mutable              | Mutable             |
| Order          | Ordered             | Unordered           |
| Duplicates     | Allowed             | Not allowed         |
| Performance    | Slower for lookups  | Faster for lookups  |

### GitHub Integration Demo
- Using Python scripts to automate simple GitHub tasks.
- Helps in managing repositories, commits, and file updates programmatically.

## How to Use

1. Open the folder in VS Code.
2. Read notes in `01-dictionaries.md` and `02-sets.md`.
3. Compare lists and sets using `03-lists-vs-sets.md`.
4. Run the demo script `04-demo-github-integration.py` to practice GitHub integration.
5. Solve exercises in `04-practicals.md` and verify solutions with `04-practicals.py`.

## Next Steps
- Practice working with nested dictionaries and sets.
- Apply set operations in real-world DevOps scenarios (e.g., unique server lists, configuration sets).
- Integrate Python scripts with GitHub repositories for automation.
